# Lot Manager - Manage a lot of vehicles or storage units with ease

Lot Manager is software built to let users get the most out of a lot space. Keep track of different vehicles that are on your lot as well as semi-trailers. The software goes so far as to let you keep track of reefers and their temperatures, and the contents of each semi-trailer. Usage is rather simple, first create a canvas, which is a 'map' of your lot. It can include points of interest that will help the user orient themselves; buildings or dead zones where no vehicles are allowed. The intention isn't to have a 1:1 scale representation, but to simply have something to let the user know where vehicles are physically located on the lot based on the map. After this is done, simply add vehicles to the lot.
