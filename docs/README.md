# Defining Lot Manager

## Tech Stack

The core application will be written in C++ using the Qt framework. Custom UI elements are used to give a more modern feel to the software, and should provide feedback as to what's going on. The database layer will be abstracted and implemented using SQLite initially for reasons of practicality, but should the project take on it would be important to implement full MariaDB or MySQL functionality.

**Language:** C++  
- Why: Performance + Qt framework compatibility  

**UI Framework:** Qt  
- Why: Cross-platform support + custom modern widgets  

**Database:** SQLite 
- Why: Single-user, zero-configuration, no server needed
